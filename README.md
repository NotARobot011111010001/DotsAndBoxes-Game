## Gameplay

Dots and Boxes is a classic paper and pencil game that is played on a grid of dots. The objective of the game is to capture more boxes than your opponent by connecting the dots with lines.

To begin the game, press play and the grid of "dots" will be drawn to the required grid size. The grid should be at least 5x5 dots, but can be larger if desired. The first player takes a turn by connecting two adjacent dots with a horizontal or vertical line. If the player completes a box, they capture it by writing their initial inside the box and taking another turn.

Play continues back and forth between the players until the entire grid is filled with lines. The player with the most captured boxes at the end of the game wins.

Dots and Boxes is a game of strategy and foresight, as players must carefully consider their moves and anticipate their opponent's next move. It's a great game to play with friends and family, and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.
